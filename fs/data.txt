80 years ago today, Soong Mei-ling addressed the United States House of Representatives. In her speech, she applauded American efforts in the Pacific theater of the World War II. She also recounted the friendship between the U.S. and China: "We in China, like you, want a better world, not for ourselves alone, but for all mankind, and we must have it." Her visit also was meant to convey appreciation for the American Lend-Lease program, which supplied war materials to sustain the Chinese resistance effort.
She was reportedly the first Asian woman to address a joint session of the US Congress.   Problems playing the file?
